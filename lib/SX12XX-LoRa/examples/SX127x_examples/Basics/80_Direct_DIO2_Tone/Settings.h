//*******  Setup hardware pin definitions here ! ***************

//These are the pin definitions for one of my own boards, the Easy Pro Mini,
//be sure to change the definitions to match your own setup. Some pins such as DIO1,
//DIO2 are not used by this particular sketch so they are set to -1 and not connected.

#define NSS 10                                  //select pin on LoRa device
#define NRESET 9                                //reset pin on LoRa device
#define LED1 8                                  //on board LED, high for on
#define DIO0 3                                  //DIO0 pin on LoRa device, used for RX and TX done 
#define DIO1 -1                                 //DIO1 pin on LoRa device, normally not used so set to -1 
#define DIO2 6                                  //DIO2 pin on LoRa device can be used for tone


#define LORA_DEVICE DEVICE_SX1278               //we need to define the device we are using
