//*******  Setup hardware pin definitions here ! ***************

//These are the pin definitions for one of my own boards, the Easy Pro Mini,
//be sure to change the definitions to match your own setup. Some pins such as DIO2,
//DIO2, BUZZER may not be in used by this sketch so they do not need to be
//connected and should be set to -1.

#define NSS 10                                  //select pin on LoRa device
#define NRESET 9                                //reset pin on LoRa device

#define DIO1 3                                  //DIO1 pin on LoRa device, used for RX and TX done 
#define DIO2 -1                                 //DIO2 pin on LoRa device, normally not used so set to -1 
#define DIO3 -1                                 //DIO3 pin on LoRa device, normally not used so set to -1
#define SW -1                                   //SW pin on Dorji devices is used to turn RF switch on\off, set to -1 if not used
