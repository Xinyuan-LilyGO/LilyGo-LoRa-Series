//*******  Setup hardware pin definitions here ! ***************

//These are the pin definitions for one of my own boards, the Easy Pro Mini,
//be sure to change the definitions to match your own setup. Some pins such as DIO1,
//DIO2, BUZZER are not used by this sketch so they do not need to be connected and
//should be set to -1.

#define NSS 10                                  //select pin on LoRa device
#define NRESET 9                                //reset pin on LoRa device
#define RFBUSY 7                                //RFBUSY pin on LoRa device   
#define LED1 8                                  //on board LED, high for on
#define DIO1 3                                  //DIO1 pin on LoRa device, used for RX and TX done 

#define LORA_DEVICE DEVICE_SX1262               //we need to define the device we are using


//*******  Setup LoRa Parameters Here ! ***************

//LoRa Modem Parameters
const uint32_t Frequency = 434000000;           //frequency of transmissions in hertz
const uint32_t Offset = 0;                      //offset frequency for calibration purposes

const uint8_t Bandwidth = LORA_BW_500;          //LoRa bandwidth
const uint8_t SpreadingFactor = LORA_SF5;       //LoRa spreading factor
const uint8_t CodeRate = LORA_CR_4_5;           //LoRa coding rate
const uint8_t Optimisation = LDRO_AUTO;         //low data rate optimisation setting, normally set to auto

const int8_t TXpower = 10;                      //LoRa transmit power in dBm


//*******  Setup packet parameters Here ! ***************
const uint8_t numberPackets = 50;               //number of packets to send in transmit loop
const uint8_t TXPacketL = 16;                   //length of packet to send  
const bool waitforACK = false;                  //set to true to have transmit wait for ack before continuing
