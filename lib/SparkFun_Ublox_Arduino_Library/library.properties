sentence=Library for I2C and Serial Communication with u-blox modules
paragraph=An Arduino Library to enable both I2C and Serial communication for both NMEA reception and binary UBX sending to u-blox modules. Useful for interfacing to the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15136">SparkFun GPS-RTK2</a> ZED-F9P, <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14980">SparkFun GPS-RTK</a> NEO-M8P-2, the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15210">SparkFun SAM-M8Q</a>, and the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15193">SparkFun ZEO-M8Q</a>. Library also works with other u-blox based boards. <br><br>The ZED-F9P and NEO-M8P-2 modules are top-of-the-line modules for high accuracy GNSS and GPS location solutions including RTK. The ZED-F9P is unique in that it is capable of both rover and base station operations allowing the module to become a base station and produce RTCM 3.x correction data.
