## Overview

* This page introduces the hardware parameters related to `LilyGo T-Beam-1W`

### Notes on use

1. This board will not charge the external 7.4V battery, it is only powered by the battery.
2. Please be sure to connect the antenna before transmitting, otherwise it is easy to damage the RF module.
3. Please note that the GPIO with * added to the external pin header GPIO name is already connected to the internal module and cannot be used
4. This RF module provides a maximum power output of 32dBm on this board

## PlatformIO Quick Start

2. Search for the `PlatformIO` plugin in the `Visual Studio Code` extension and install it.
3. After the installation is complete, you need to restart `Visual Studio Code`
4. After restarting `Visual Studio Code`, select `File` in the upper left corner of `Visual Studio Code` -> `Open Folder` -> select the `LilyGo-LoRa-Series` directory
5. Wait for the installation of third-party dependent libraries to complete
6. Click on the `platformio.ini` file, and in the `platformio` column
7. Select the board name you want to use in `default_envs` and uncomment it.
8. Uncomment one of the lines `src_dir = xxxx` to make sure only one line works , Please note the example comments, indicating what works and what does not.
9. Click the (✔) symbol in the lower left corner to compile
10. Connect the board to the computer USB-C , Micro-USB is used for module firmware upgrade

> \[!IMPORTANT]
> 
> LDO EN pin is control pin inside the module:
> 
> 1. High level turns on the Radio
> 2. Low level turns off the Radio
> 
> LoRa Ctrl pin is internal LNA power control of the module:
> 
> 1. When receiving data, set it to high level and turn on the LNA power;
> 2. When transmitting data and sleeping, set it to low level and turn off the LNA power.

### Frequently asked questions

1. When testing or using, connect the antenna first, then power on to transmit the signal.
2. The module uses a high-gain, high-efficiency power amplifier. When the output power of SX1262 is +22dBm (max), the module output power is maximum.
3. Suggestion: Please give the internal PA stabilization time before transmitting data: For SX1262 chip, the recommended configuration value is >800us

  ![RampTime](./images/RampTime.jpg)

4. When the module is ready to transmit/receive data, you need to switch the RF Switch on the module to the transmit/receive channel in advance. This switch is a single-pole double-throw switch. See the figure below for the truth table

| DIO2 PIN | CTRL PIN | RF Switch Status                                               |
| -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | 0        | ANT and TX channels connected, PA turned on, LNA powered off   |
| 0        | 1        | ANT and RX channels are connected, PA is closed, LNA is opened |

5. **During TX DATA, if the switch is not switched to the correct position in advance, the PA chip inside the module is likely to be damaged.**
